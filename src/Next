Unseen to code : 
Given an array of n integers, find the lexicographically smallest subsequence of length k.

Not solved yet: 
Given a matrix of people(denoted by small alphabets) and bikes(denoted by capital alphabets), find the nearest bike for a given person.
How will you change your solution if you have to find bikes for a set of people? (assuming multiple bikes can be at the same distance from 1 person)

Seen question to code(Confidence boost):
Print all nodes at distance K from given node
Connect nodes at same level

Question 1 – You are given 3 array A, B, C you need to find all possible combinations such that A[i1] + B[i2] = B[i3] + C[i4].

Question  2 – You are given with a string S. You need to find maximum length of string S after deleting some or none characters from S such that it can in form of T+T, where T is substring of S.

For example S = abcababc, maximum length of string S will be 6 after deleting a, b from position 4, 5.
